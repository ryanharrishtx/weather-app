# Weather App
This is a Weather App built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. When you input any city in the world, it will return the current weather for that city, as well as the weather for the next 5 days. It will also store the input in local storage and then create a button that is appended to a display section as a clickable button. Upon clicking the button with the city name, it pulls the data for that city again and fills in the cards appropriately! Below are the User Story and Acceptance Criteria:
